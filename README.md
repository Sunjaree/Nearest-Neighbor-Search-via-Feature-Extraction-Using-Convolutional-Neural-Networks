# Nearest-Neighbor-Search-via-Feature-Extraction-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This project will utilize CNN models and feature extraction techniques to identify similarities between different images.

<p align="justify">
This project aims to develop an efficient system for similarity search using image feature extraction. We explore feature extraction techniques from a given dataset by leveraging various CNN models such as VGG16, ResNet101, ZFNet, and MobileNet. The system takes an input image and rapidly retrieves the ten closest images based on feature similarity, enabling effective content-based image retrieval.
Here, we compare the feature representation of a query image with the entire dataset. We employ distance metrics like the Euclidean distance and cosine similarity to compute similarity scores efficiently. After that, we present the top 10 most similar images as the final result.
